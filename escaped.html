            <p class="p-md pad-md-bottom font-freighttextpro p-md-black">Sam’s gaze drifted between the cracks in the asphalt, intermediately disrupted by the passing cars. The sidewalks now glowed a harsh grey ever since snow became a rare sight. Combined with the concrete beam bridge, this section of the path looked almost Brutalist.<br><br>The April cherry blossoms were a staple of Boston. They were the only reason Sam went out of his way to come to the esplanade. From an architectural standpoint, the arch bridge there was nothing special, but it complements the cherry blossoms so well that Sam couldn’t help but admire it. A few students from his school also had the idea of coming here. Their chatter was drowned out by Sam’s headphones.<br><br>Sam walked onto the bridge. The brick inlays were disappointing, but his music made it bearable. A pair of legs were getting unusually close. Sam quickened his pace to put some distance between them, but to no avail.<br><br>“Hey.” It was a girl.<br><br>With one hand, Sam reluctantly pulled down his headphones.<br><br>“You’re the new transfer, right?” She continued.<br><br>“Umm…yeah.”<br><br>“I’m Agnes. Everyone calls me Ann.”<br><br>“Oh, hi.”<br><br>“Ann, we’re taking a photo!” Another girl yelled.<br><br>“Coming!” She replied. “We’ll talk later, okay?”<br><br>“Uh-”<br><br><span class="p-italic">Wait, I haven’t told you my name</span>. Sam reached for her with his right hand, but she was already gone.</p>

            <p class="p-md pad-md-bottom font-freighttextpro p-md-black">Up until weeks ago, Sam always walked home alone. His commute took him through a quiet section of town filled with warehouses. Other than the occasional trucks, nothing ever came between Sam and his music. Not anymore.<br><br>The girl he met on the bridge slowly but surely made her way into his routine. It annoyed Sam at first, but he had gotten used to her voice.<br><br>“It’s pretty, isn’t it?” She said, holding a cherry blossom petal against the sky.<br><br>“Yeah. The sky compliments the pink quite well.”<br><br>He’d grown a little more talkative in that time if only to stop her from complaining about how he’s always so disinterested. “You’re always so gloomy,” she’d say, “it’s kinda hard to talk to you, ya know?” <span class="p-italic">It’s not your fault, I’m just preoccupied with my –</span><br><br>“They’re having a party over at Ray’s this Saturday.”<br><br>“Oh. I didn’t know.”<br><br>“I want you to come.” She was serious.<br><br>“Umm, I…I don’t go to par -”<br><br>“I know, that&#x27;s why I want you to come.”<br><br>“But, I don’t like them.”<br><br>“Trust me, it’ll be fun! Can you please come? Just for me?”<br><br>There was no getting out of it. “Alright,” Sam said reluctantly.</p>

            <p class="p-md pad-md-bottom font-freighttextpro p-md-black">Sam could only describe the music as deafening noise. Why do people enjoy this? All the detail was drowned out by the bass, the treble was distorted beyond recognition, and the mids had almost no sound stage.<br><br>She was off to the side talking with some friends. Sam was surprised they could hear each other. He did his best to stay away from the larger speakers that flanked the room. When is this going to end? She started walking towards him. <span class="p-italic">Maybe we’re leaving now?</span><br><br>“Oh come on, don’t just shove yourself in a corner all night.”<br><br>“I told you I don’t like this.”<br><br>“Yeah, not if you’re just going to sit there!” She grabbed his hand and yanked him away from his seat. “Now come and dance.”<br><br>She dragged him into the crowd and told him to follow her moves. While she danced effortlessly to the beat, Sam struggled to make his awkward flailing resemble coordinated movement.<br><br>“That’s it! Let loose!”<br><br><span class="p-italic">Let loose, yeah, sounds good. </span><br><br><br><br>“Owww,” she groaned, rubbing her feet gently with her hand.<br><br>“You can have my shoes.” Sam felt bad watching the girl walk barefoot. Her high heels now swung loosely in his hand.<br><br>“No, it&#x27;s okay. The ground isn’t that bad. And besides, your shoes are way too big.”<br><br>It was already dark. A few street lamps dotted the way on the esplanade. The silence was much welcomed after hours of deafening music. The small arch bridge where they first met caught the girl’s attention. She skipped towards it playfully.<br><br>“Come on, come on,” she yelled. “Let’s jump!”<br><br>“What? No! You’ll catch a cold.” Sam was baffled. “I’ve also got my phone, and my jacket too.”<br><br>“Oh <span class="p-italic">come on</span>. Just leave those up here.”<br><br>“No, that’s crazy. Let’s go home.” Yet, he still walked up to her.<br><br>By the time Sam took off his jacket, she already made her way on top of the railing, smiling.<br><br>“You sure about this?”<br><br>“Yeah! Get up here.”<br><br>Sam grabbed her hand, trying his best to stabilize himself. “Whoa -”<br><br>A thundering splash was followed by a cold sensation that engulfed Sam. <span class="p-italic">Shit, this is cold</span>. The tickling bubbles and adrenaline-fueled excitement were novel to him. <br><br>‍<span class="p-italic">What is this?</span><br><br><br><br>A trail of water followed the two teenagers. “That was amazing,” she claimed. Sam couldn’t disagree, although he could do without the shivering. At least they are both barefoot now.<br><br>“Look at that.” She pointed towards a bright object in the sky, water still dripping from her fingertip.<br><br>“That’s Venus, it’s very bright right now.”<br><br>“I’ve always been fascinated by astronomy,” she said, staring at Venus. “Aurorae, comets, supernovae, they all seem so impossibly beautiful.”<br><br>“Yeah, my parents used to tell me all about them. I mean, they were aerospace engineers, so I guess it was part of their job.”<br><br>Sam paused, the twitching in his right arm alarmed him. <span class="p-italic">No</span>.<br><br>“Um, I’ve gotta go,” he said abruptly. “Here, and you can keep my jacket, just give it back next Monday. Sorry, I need to run.”<br><br>Sam took off without looking back. He felt horrible leaving her behind like that – drenched and barefoot. He hated that feeling. <span class="p-italic">Don’t let her get too close. Don’t let this end like it did with mom.</span></p>

            <p class="p-md pad-md-bottom font-freighttextpro p-md-black">It was one of those rainstorms that struck Boston once in a while. The rain was nearly horizontal, pounding loud against the window. Sam stared blankly at the faint hint of sunlight on his bedsheet. A crumpled letter laid next to him. “New Eden Hospital Center,” said the large title in serif. It was his doctor advising him to move forward with his treatment plan. “To ease the pain in the last few months, I recommend initiating the medically induced coma soon.”<br><br>Sam had always known it would come to this. <span class="p-italic">It’s just a little early</span>. He struggled to comprehend his condition when he first heard about it. “I’ll be okay, right mom,” he’d ask. “You’ll be fine, Sam. Everything will be fine.” He used to think he’s somehow special, that he’s the only one who’d survive such an illness. <span class="p-italic">Maybe they’ll come up with a cure by then</span>. But he wasn’t special, and there was no cure.<br><br>“Most of the neurons in this area are damaged. It’s spreading quicker than we expected. You have a few months, a few years at most. I’m terribly sorry.” He didn’t even bother to ask about experimental treatments. He had accepted it by then. <span class="p-italic">I’m going to die</span>.<br><br>He didn’t tell anyone about this. He transferred schools so that no one would notice his changes and bother him about it. <span class="p-italic">I don’t want to hurt anyone. I don’t want them to cry about me. I want my death to change nothing</span>.<br><br>Loud, repeated knocks on the door caught Sam’s attention. <span class="p-italic">Someone’s here?</span> He quickly shoved the few empty pill bottles into a bag and tossed it under his bed. The letter was hastily hidden under the bedsheet as he ran to open the door.<br><br>“Hey,” she said, half soaked through, a torn-up umbrella in her left hand. “Could I come in for a minute?”<br><br>“Oh, yeah, of course. What happened to you?”<br><br>“I lost my keys somewhere. Ugh. I already called my landlord; she’ll be here soon.”<br><br>“Here,” Sam said, plugging in a hairdryer. “You can dry yourself off with this.”<br><br>“Oh, thanks.”<br><br>Sam sat down on his bed, watching the girl by his desk. <span class="p-italic">It’s the first time someone’s been in here.</span><br><br>“What’s this?” The object in question was a weirdly shaped model. Two long panels jutted out from the top, three smaller ones were anchored to the bottom.<br><br>“That? It’s an Iridium satellite. My dad gave it to me when he left the team.”<br><br>“So this is what your dad worked on?”<br><br>“My mom too, actually. They were both engineers.”<br><br>“You like this stuff too, don’t you?”<br><br>“Yeah, I guess. They’ve always wanted me to follow in their footsteps.”<br><br>Putting the model back, she accidentally knocked over an old notebook. The pieces of loose paper once tucked inside now covered the table.<br><br>“Oh, I’m sorry,” she said, picking up the closest piece. “Whoa, are you an artist?”<br><br>“Well, I -” Sam paused, “- I used to draw.”<br><br>“These are really good.” Flipping through the pages, she stopped at a drawing of a human heart. “What do you mean ‘used to?’”<br><br><br><br>It all started when his mom sent him to an art class. The first week, he brought back a sketch of a cube – rough, crooked, and inconsistent. “That’s nice,” she said. It was one of the few times she’d ever praised him. So, Sam kept at it. Years and years of practice earned him multiple awards and a bit of a reputation. “That’s him?” people would whisper every time he showed up, “Yeah, that’s the one.” He’d draw next to much older artists, waiting for the examiner to come and rate their work. The slightly tall easel, the odd glaze from other people, little of that bothered Sam. <span class="p-italic">It will make mom happy.</span> It did, but not for long.<br><br>“This is such a waste of time! You should be <span class="p-italic">studying</span>! You’re going to be an engineer, son. An <span class="p-italic">engineer</span>!” Sam stood there silently, the drawing he was displaying proudly a second ago now hidden behind his legs. As his mother’s illness worsened, she grew increasingly discontent with Sam’s pursuit of art. An engineer, that was the Sam she wanted. Yet, he’d fallen in love with art. He couldn’t give it up. For the longest time, he tried to compromise.<br><br>But, with the passing of his mother, Sam could no longer draw. A wave of grief always consumed him when he tried. It felt like choking. <span class="p-italic">No matter what I do, I can’t make people happy. I can’t keep them around. I can’t do anything</span>. So, he stopped, tucked away all his works, and moved to a city where no one has heard of him.<br><br><br><br>Sam told her all this. The heavy rain felt oddly fitting as the two sat silently in that small room.<br><br>“You shouldn&#x27;t blame yourself.” She finally broke the silence. “Everyone dies. No one can change that.”<br><br>“I couldn’t even make her happy.”<br><br>“But you tried, didn’t you? You loved her.”<br><br>“So <span class="p-italic">what</span>? All that did was hurt her, hurt me. It’d be better if I never existed.”<br><br>“We all know it might hurt when we love someone. But we do it anyway.”<br><br>“Why? <span class="p-italic">Why?</span>”</p>

There it is!” She found the supposedly famous cake shop she couldn’t stop talking about.<br><br>“Fancy.”<br><br>“Well, it is kinda expensive. But, but! The cakes here are <span class="p-italic">incredible</span>.”<br><br>Cakes were never something Sam liked. They were okay, the cream always had a weird texture and they were often too sweet. Yet, what the girl presented in front of him was very different from the store-bought birthday cakes Sam was imagining.<br><br>“Whoa, this is really good,” Sam said uncharacteristically.<br><br>“Yeah, I told you, they are amazing!”<br><br>“How did they make it layered like that? And the flavor is perfect too.”<br><br>“The layered texture is what they’re famous for. It’s their secret. Although I’m not a huge fan of the green tea flavor.”<br><br>“Hmmm,” Sam took a piece of the green tea flavored cake and chewed on it. “I mean, it is a little dry, but I think it’s good.”<br><br>“Well, you can have the rest of that then.”<br><br>“I see you’re just giving me the stuff you don’t like.”<br><br>“It’s not like that, dummy.” She searched around in her bag, finally emerging with her phone. “Here, let’s take a picture.”<br><br>As Sam tried to position himself inside the frame, she smeared some cream onto his face.<br><br>“Hey! What was that?”<br><br>“Hahahaha! It looks good on you!”<br><br>“You -” Sam grabbed another piece with his fork and waved it at her face, missing. “Come back here!”<br><br>“You can’t get me! Haha!”<br><br>“Hey! Stop with the pictures!”<br><br>They chased each other around the store, no doubt annoying the other customers. A few glares came their way, but Sam cared little.<br><br><span class="p-italic">I’m not sure what it is about her, but please, please let this last an eternity.</span></p>

He’s pretty essential to the plot and he’s got a big fanbase. They can’t just kill him off like that.”<br><br>The two sat on the floor, leaning against Sam’s bed. The monitor at the edge of the desk was playing some show thanks to the pile of cables, splitters, and adapters Sam had rigged up.<br><br>“Ah!” Sam retrieved his hand from the bag of chips. “You finished them already?”<br><br>“Yup.” A mischievous smile on her face.<br><br>It was a rather hot day. The heat bled through the window no matter what setting the AC was on. Neither of them felt like going outside.<br><br>Sunlight peeked through the blinds onto her legs. They glowed. It made Sam feel a little melancholy. <span class="p-italic">I wish this could last.</span><br><br>She suddenly leaned onto Sam’s shoulder, her hand now firmly pressing against his. <span class="p-italic">Huh?</span><br><br>“I like this,” she whispered very softly. “You’ll stay next to me, right?”<br><br>She sounded very sincere, too sincere. Sam looked over at her, but her hair obscured her eyes. <span class="p-italic">I want to. I really do. But –</span>. Sam had to leave in a few days for his treatment. He would never be this close to her again.<br><br>“I -” Sam paused.<br><br>She slowly took her hand away.<br><br>“No. It’s not because of you. Please don’t get the wrong idea.”<br><br>“I know.”<br><br>“I -” Sam took a deep breath. “I have to go in a few days because of my treatment. I have a terminal neurological disease. I’m sorry, but – but I can’t stay here any longer.”<br><br>“Is -” She was clearly in shock. “Is this going to be the end?”<br><br>“It’s a very tough disease that degenerates nerves over time. They were always looking for a cure but they still need a protein that can -”<br><br>“Answer me.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“What will they do?”<br><br>“A medically induced coma. But I’ll be going in a little earlier for some tests and medication.”<br><br>“So you’re just going to leave everyone and everything behind?” She was crying.<br><br>“It’s not like I want to! I just don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want anyone to cry over my death. I want things to stay the same with or without me! Why would I stay here and cause people pain?”<br><br>“You’ve always been like this! That’s why you’re always alone, isn’t it? You stay so distant from people so you don’t have to feel responsible for their feelings. You shut yourself in here so you don’t have to worry about people hurting you. You never love because you fear the pain. You think it’s all so meaningless because death was always around the corner -”<br><br>“It’s not like I chose this! I never wanted to die! I never thought this is how my life would be. I’m not like you, I don’t have all the time in the world to spend. Every time I tried to love someone it just all goes to shit! How is that my fault?”<br><br>“Don’t go, Sam, <span class="p-italic">please</span>.”<br><br>“Just get out. It’s not as easy as you always make it sound.

It was hard to tell if she was joking or if she thought it was a good idea.</span><br><br>“I’m sorry.”<br><br>“About what?”<br><br>“What I said a few days ago. I was just scared, and I didn’t know what to do or say. I really didn’t mean to hurt you.”<br><br>“Hey, it’s okay. Remember what I said? ‘We all know it might hurt when we love someone. But we do it anyway.’”<br><br>“I was always running away from the world. I thought that if I kept everyone at a distance, I wouldn’t get hurt and death wouldn’t seem so daunting.”<br><br>“But would you really be alive then?”<br><br>“I don’t think so. I never thought of it that way until you came along.”<br><br>“Ha! Speaking of which, that’s that bridge where we first met. You know, I never thought we’d turn out like this back then.”<br><br>“What? You mean me carrying you on my back, talking about death?”<br><br>“Haha. No, dummy! I meant I never thought we’d fall in love and all that. I never thought you’d make it into my heart.”<br><br><span class="p-italic">A few drops of her tears made their way onto my neck. They felt warm. She clutched my shirt tightly with both hands as if some storm was going to blow her away.<br></span><br>“I’m scared, Sam. I don’t want to die.”<br><br>“I know,” <span class="p-italic">I nudged her left arm with my chin.</span> “But I’m here, and your friends, and everyone you love. So let’s make the most out of what little time we have left.”<br><br>“Th-thank you, for everything.” <span class="p-italic">Her clutch loosened slightly.</span><br><br><br><br>“Phew, we finally made it. Man, you are heavy.” <span class="p-italic">That was clearly not what she wanted to hear.</span> “Ow! What was that for?”<br><br>“Haven’t anyone told you never to call a girl ‘heavy?’ Hmph.” <span class="p-italic">She pretended to be mad, but I could only describe her expression as cute.</span> “And, you still haven’t told me what this place is.”<br><br>“It’s Prospect Hill Park. You can see the whole of Boston from here, but that’s not why we’re here.”<br><br>“So why are we here?”<br><br>“Remember that weird model you saw at my place a while ago? The Iridium satellite?”<br><br>“Oh yeah, the one your parents worked on.”<br><br>“Yup. They have these antenna arrays that reflect the Sun back to us on Earth. So, if we wait here for just a bit longer, we will see a very bright spot in the sky.”<br><br>“Really? That’s so cool!”<br><br>“They’re called Iridium flares. They can be brighter than Venus at times. My parents always told me stories about them.”<br><br>“You knew about this all this time and you never told me?”<br><br>“Well, I never actually thought about them until now.”<br><br><span class="p-italic">There were a few other observers with us. Some carried long-range lenses and tripods with them.</span><br><br>“People like these, don’t they?”<br><br>“Yeah, they’ve been up there since 1997. I guess people get attached.”<br><br><span class="p-italic">It was then that a spot appeared in the night sky. It seemed just like any other star at first, faint and ordinary. But it was moving. It glowed brighter by the second, outshining everything next to it.</span><br><br>“Woah.”<br><br><span class="p-italic">It was so bright that the moon almost paled in comparison. So this was what my parents loved. It’s no less beautiful than the things I love. Perhaps this was why they pushed me so hard to see things their way.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">The Iridium flare was gone just seconds after it appeared. Fading into the background of stars as if it never existed.</span><br><br>“That was really pretty!” <span class="p-italic">I’m glad she liked it.</span> “Let’s come see it again!”<br><br>“Well, that was actually the last one we could see here in Boston.”<br><br>“What? Why?”<br><br>“All the Iridium satellites are being replaced. They’ll be deorbited and burn up in the atmosphere.”<br><br>“Right.”<br><br>“To think my parents spent all that time working on something that’ll just burn up one day.”<br><br>“Just because it’ll be gone doesn’t make it any less beautiful.” <span class="p-italic">She looked around at the other observers.</span> “It doesn’t make it any less worth pursuing.”<br><br>“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”<br><br>“It’s just like us, you know? Gone in a blink of an eye. But it’s still worth it.”<br><br>“That’s a good metaphor. I think I’ll need to put that down on paper.”<br><br>“It’s not a metaphor, dummy! But, what do these satellites actually do?”<br><br>“Oh, they’re communication satellites. They allow you to call from anywhere on Earth.”<br><br>“I thought they must have been for astronomical observations.”<br><br>“Yeah. To think that we have the power to go beyond the clouds, to discover whatever meaning there may be in the universe, just to use it so we could talk to each other.”<br><br><br><br><span class="p-italic">She twiddled with my hair as I carried her back to the hospital. It was rather serene. The streetlights shined in the distance, not nearly as pretty as the Iridium flares, but they shone, nonetheless. I decided it was time to tell her.</span><br><br>“I love you, Ann.”<br><br>“Hmph! Took you long enough! All you did was ask me if I like astronomy when I told you I loved you.”<br><br>“Haha. Yeah, sorry about that. I got a little caught up.”<br><br>“I love you too, Sam. I know we don’t have much time, but I’m glad it was you.”<br><br><span class="p-italic">I looked up at the sky again, somehow hoping that a miracle would bring the Iridium flare back. But there was nothing.</span><br><br>“Say,” <span class="p-italic">she was now playing with my ear.</span> “If you knew this was how it’ll end from the start, would you do it all again?”<br><br><span class="p-italic">That question caught me off guard. Do it all again? All the pain, all the suffering, all the tears? Yet, I’d get to spend time with her again. I’d get to talk with my parents again. Perhaps. I think it’s all worth it for these few moments of happiness.</span><br><br>“Yeah, I think I’ll do it again.”</p>

            <p class="p-md pad-md-bottom font-freighttextpro p-md-black"><span class="p-italic">Turns out, one of the things she wanted was to see the fireworks in Chengdu. They would light them at the top of a tower some 300 meters above the ground. “It’s like a giant glowing flower!”</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">It wasn’t easy getting us last-minute plane tickets. I think I just got really lucky. The plane would leave at two in the afternoon. I decided to tell her to meet me at eleven so we couldn’t possibly miss the flight.</span><br><br>“Are you almost here?” <span class="p-italic">I texted her.</span><br><br>“Yeah, coming up on the intersection. I had to get some sunscreen from the store.”<br><br><span class="p-italic">Typical Ann, waiting till the last minute.</span> “You got your passport and everything? The tickets are with me.” <span class="p-italic">She didn’t respond immediately. She could be coming around the corner any second now.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">The sidewalks felt different now. Their grey glare no longer bothered me. My eyes no longer dwelled on the asphalt. Instead, the last few cherry blossoms caught my attention. For a world so cruel, it was awfully beautiful. I’m glad I stayed. I’m glad it was her.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">A few more minutes went by and she still didn’t show up. Maybe she was at a different intersection? I started walking in her direction. An ambulance sped past me, sirens blaring. Ann?</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">At the intersection was a car with a dented hood, right next to a puddle of blood. Her phone laid there on the asphalt.</span></p>
            <div class="article-subtitle">
              <h3 class="h3-md font-freighttextpro heading-sticky pad-md-bottom pad-sm-mobile">ZERO</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="p-md pad-md-bottom font-freighttextpro p-md-black"><span class="p-italic">She died in that ambulance. A car that ran a red light – that was what killed her. She bled so much nothing could have possibly saved her.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">As part of her will, I received a package. In it was a pack of pencils, two sheets of blank photo paper, and a single photo of me chasing her in that cake shop.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">On the back of that photo, she wrote:</span><br><br>“It’s funny how the happiest moments in life are so mundane. I love you. I love you. I love you. I wish I could have said it more when I was alive. It was so short, but I think that’s what makes it so sweet.”</p>
            <div class="article-subtitle">
              <h3 class="h3-md font-freighttextpro heading-sticky">NEGATIVE ONE</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="p-md font-freighttextpro p-md-black"><span class="p-italic">It’s been four months since she died. My room was filled with the smell of freshly sharpened pencils. Next to the pile of wood shavings was a new easel that held up a portrait of her. The Sun glimmered on the graphite.</span><br><br>“Hey, Sam! Come down soon or we’ll miss the festival!” <span class="p-italic">Ray was here already.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">I framed that photo she left me. It now sat right next to that Iridium satellite model. The whole Iridium satellite network was gone now, deorbited. Iridium flares are only a memory of the past.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">My illness has worsened. I can now feel constant pain in my fingertips. But I never went into a coma, that much she has taught me. Sometimes, I could almost hear her.</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">“Dummy! Stop thinking about me and go greet your friend down there! Ray won’t wait forever!”</span><br><br><span class="p-italic">I keep her memories close to my heart even though it hurts. I love her. That is why I keep on living despite the pain. In the end, she never gave me her physical heart, but she left me the whole world.</span></p>
